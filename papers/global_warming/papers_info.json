    "summary": "Lightning activity on a global scale has been studied season wise using\nsatellite data for the period from 1998 to 2009. Lightning activity shows an\nincreasing trend during the period of study which is highly correlated with\natmospheric warming. A similar increasing trend of lightning activity is\nobserved in the Indian region during the pre-monsoon season which is correlated\nwith global lightning trends and warming trends of surface temperature in\nIndia.\n  Key words: Global warming, lightning activity, Solar cycle changes",
